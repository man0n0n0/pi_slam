## methods (from SLAM-PYTHON repo) https://github.com/DanielsKraus/SLAM-python/blob/master/robot_class.py
- Extended Kalman Filter : concurrently estimate a robot's position and create a map of its environment. Is an adaptation of the Kalmanan filter for nonlinear systems, making it suitable for SLAM
- Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation
- Bundle Adjustment (BA) : scene geometry, the parameters of the relative motion, and the optical characteristics of the camera(s) employed to acquire the images, given a set of images depicting a number of 3D points from different viewpoints.
